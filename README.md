# Interop

Define package manager and package interoperability rules.
Generate project templates on the fly, independent of project manager and package compositions.

# Motivation

Creating a custom project with a specific set of libraries and/or configurations takes time.
create-react-app for example offers two base templates one for plain javascript and the other
for typescript. Adding additional libraries that don't work out of the box needs configuration.



# TODO:

- [ ] Add package function that normalizes package names (for switch case/if else)
- [ ] Update Package configurations in parallel
- [ ]


# Installation

```shell
$ npm i -S interop
```
